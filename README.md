# Hipwatch

This is a trivial hack that lets you know what Hipchat users have been added or removed since the last time it ran. To use it, you need to obtain a Hipchat API user key (V2).

To use:

1. Create a config.json file (see example)
1. Run

The state file specified in the configuration will be written as output.

Bugs:

- Plenty
